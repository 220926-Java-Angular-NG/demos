# Mini Project - Horoscope App

## Overview

Create a simple Web App that uses the following api `http://sandipbgt.com/theastrologer/api/horoscope/pisces/today`

Note that where the api says 'pisces' you can interpolate in any of the zodiac signs. Use Postman to test the api Before you begin.

### MVP -
This project must make the following webpages:

    1. Welcome/Index page:
        - a user should be able to sign in

    2. Register page:
		- a new user should be able to register for an account 
			with at least a first and last name, email/username, password 
			and zodiac sign.
    3. Homepage:
    	- Display the users information in the webpage  - i.e "name etc"

        - Get 'today's' horoscope for the current logged-in user
        	and display it on the webpage

        - Allow for a user to request their 'mood' (hint: 'mood' is a property in the JSON)

		- Update the db with the users 'mood'

Based on the users birthdate, identify the zodiac sign and add it to users profile
